    <h1>Welcome to My Project</h1>
    <p>This page houses a few data science projects I have individually created.</p>
    <p>In the first project, the fictitious goal was to increase a university department's enrollement through course reduction and course groupings. 
        Two datasets were provided: the available courses and the enrollement history. First the datasets were cleaned, removing all obselete courses
        and courses with 0 enrollements. From there, a unique ID was created for each course. Next, statistical analysis was conducted in order to 
        determine the distribution of enrollements. From there, it was decided that all courses with enrollement below the first quantile value should be 
        eliminated and all courses above the third quantile value should be 'group leaders'. Finally, the Apriori algorithm was applied to determine
        advantageous course groupings.</p>
    <p>In the second project, I create a data warehouse in PosgresSQL and Hadoop, then compare the results. The goal was to store and return interesting
        information regarding election contributions by state. Having familiarity with RDBMS was very helpful, as that process was much easier than 
        the Hadoop counterpart.</p>
