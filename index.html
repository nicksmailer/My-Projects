        <p>This page houses a few data science projects I have individually created, as well as reflections on interesting topics.</p>

                <a href="final_project.docx" target="_blank">Increasing Enrollment</a><br>
                In this document, I outline the steps taken to achieve the fictitious goal of increasing an imaginary university's art department's enrollment through course reduction and course groupings. Two datasets were provided: the available courses and the enrollment history. First, the datasets were cleaned, removing all obsolete courses and courses with 0 enrollments. From there, a unique ID was created for each course. Next, statistical analysis was conducted to determine the distribution of enrollments. From there, it was decided that all courses with enrollment below the first quantile value should be eliminated and all courses above the third quantile value should be 'group leaders'. Finally, the Apriori algorithm was applied to determine advantageous course groupings.

                <a href="term_project.docx" target="_blank">RDBMS Data Warehouse VS Hadoop</a><br>
                In this document, I create a data warehouse in PostgreSQL and Hadoop, then compare the results. The goal was to store and return interesting information regarding election contributions by state. Having familiarity with RDBMS was very helpful, as that process was much easier than the Hadoop counterpart.

                In this document, I summarize cutting-edge maze generation tactics and search algorithms. Search algorithms have a wide range of applications, with GPS being a well-known example.
